```javascript
userResponse = client.user.get()
```

```javascript
assert.equal( userResponse.status, 200 )

```

Update the authenticated user

```javascript
/*
Here we pass empty object as argument, as we do not want to affect your personal data.
If you wish to call the method sufficiently, you may pass for example the following argument:
{
  company: "My New Company",
  blog: "My new blog"
}
for complete list of the user object fields refer to the variable userResponse.body initialized two code blocks above
*/

```

```javascript
assert.equal( patchUserResponse.status, 200 )
```

  "name": repoName
})
```

```javascript
assert.equal( repoCreateResponse.status, 201 )

```

List repositories for the authenticated user. Note that this does not include
repositories owned by organizations which the user can access. You can lis

Link header to get the URL for the next page of repositories.

```javascript
starredRepoResponse = client.user.starred.ownerId( ownerId ).repoId( repoId ).get()
```

```javascript
assert.equal( starredRepoResponse.status, 204 )

Let's delete a public key which could have been created during previous notebook runs.

```javascript
if( Object.prototype.toString.call( keysResponse.body ) === '[object Array]' ){
  for(var ind in keysResponse.body){
    var key = keysResponse.body[ind]
    var l = key.key.length
    if(keyValue.slice(0,l)==key.key){
      client.user.keys.keyId( key.id ).delete()
    }
  }
}
```

Create a public key.

```javascript
keyCreateResponse = client.user.keys.post({
  "title": keyTitle,
  "key": keyValue
})
```

```javascript
assert.equal( keyCreateResponse.status, 201 )
keyId = keyCreateResponse.body.id
```

Get a single public key

```javascript
keyResponse = client.user.keys.keyId( keyId ).get()
```

```javascript
assert.equal( keyResponse.status, 200 )
```

Delete a public key

```javascript
deleteKeyResponse = client.user.keys.keyId( keyId ).delete()
```

```javascript
assert.equal( deleteKeyResponse.status, 204 )
```

List email addresses for a user.
In the final version of the API, this method will return an array of hashes
with extended information for each email address indicating if the address
has been verified and if it's primary email address for GitHub.
Until API v3 is finalized, use the application/vnd.github.v3 media type to
get other response format.

```javascript
emailsResponse = client.user.emails.get()
```

```javascript
assert.equal( emailsResponse.status, 200 )
```

Let's generate a dummy email so that we could test email adding ad removing.

```javascript
dummyEmail = ""
{
  var email = emailsResponse.body[0].email
  var ind = email.indexOf('@')
  dummyEmail = email.substring(0,ind)+"@somehost.com"
}
```

Add email address(es).
You can post a single email address or an array of addresses.

```javascript

assert.equal( postEmailsResponse.status, 201 )
```

Delete email address(es).
You can include a single email address or an array of addresses.

```javascript
emailsResponse = client.user.emails.delete( [ dummyEmail ] )
```

```javascript
assert.equal( emailsResponse.status, 204 )
```

Let's create an issue before retreiving a list of issues.

```javascript

```javascript
subscriptionsResponse = client.user.subscriptions.get()

```

```javascript
assert.equal( deleteRepoResponse.status, 204 )

```
